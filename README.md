# Luzifer / gpg\_verify

This project is mainly a proof-of-concept for myself whether it is possible to have a small web-service to check the detached signatures of a file hosted somewhere in the web and generating a badge for the integrity of the file.

## Context

Assume this: You need to provide a PDF document in the internet which will be downloaded at some time by any person not being capable of verifying a GPG signature for this document. Though the person is required to check whether the document has not been altered since you uploaded it several time ago.

Using this service you can embed a badge into the same page which is generated by a small service downloading the PDF document and a detached signature file and verifying them. The person having to trust the contents of the PDF now sees a badge stating the file still has its original contents.
